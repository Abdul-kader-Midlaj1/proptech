          <p>
            Despite global headwinds, the real estate market in Dubai continues to leap over other metropolises amid 
global economic challenges. The influx of HNWIs and overseas buyers investing in Dubai’s high-end 
developments with residents eyeing for stability and benefits from the new freehold and visa-related 
reforms, a rush of first-time home buyers has proven the resiliency of the Emirate that holds an abundance 
of safe and unmatched opportunities as a global hub for business, tourism and innovation <br><br>
Dubai Real Estate had over 84,196 real estate transactions in 2021 worth almost AED 300 billion. The value 
of these transactions is the highest it’s ever been in the recorded history of Dubai Real Estate Q2 2022 
.
 of 45.86 percent for volume and an increase of 61.56 
when compared to Q2 2021 showed an increase 
percent for value.  <br><br>
Proptech, a combination of property and technology cites to the management, handling, and
